# BusbyHAddingNumbersEndpoints

This program will take a user input inside of a URL and add the two together. The program will then take the sum of the two user-inputted numbers and paste the response
in the terminal. 

Peer reviewed by: Peer reviewed by: Peer Review: Brandon Le - Web API project works as intended. I'm able to get the sum of two numbers when I input it into the URL after /addingnumbers/adding numbers/ **Make sure to have a space between adding and numbers for the second part of the URL to make it work, I missed that small detail in the beginning and was having trouble getting it to work. 
I would suggest choosing a different route name just to avoid the same type of issue in the future, but other than that it does what it needed to do! Good Job Harrison :)
